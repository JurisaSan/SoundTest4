Hearing Test Application

This user-friendly application is specifically designed to perform hearing tests across a range of sound frequencies. I developed it for personal use while contemplating surgery for my right ear, and it assumes the user is wearing headphones. 

Key Features:
Single Ear Testing: The app currently supports testing for the right ear only, using the right channel of your headphones. To test the left ear, you can either update the code or simply swap the sides of your headphones.
Frequency Range: It includes 10 test frequencies, spanning from the lowest at 200 Hz to the highest at 10 kHz.
Volume Caution: Please adjust your system volume to 50% before starting the application to ensure the test is conducted safely. Be cautious with sound levels to protect your hearing.

Usage Tips:
Ensure you are in a quiet environment for accurate results.
If you experience discomfort at any point, immediately stop the test and adjust or reduce the volume.

This application is tailored for individuals experiencing hearing issues in one ear, providing a straightforward way to assess your hearing needs before considering medical interventions.

The application is using (based on) NAudio package.
